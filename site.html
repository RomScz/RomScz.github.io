                <p>In this group project focused on web development, our team was tasked with creating a website to assist students of CESI engineering school in finding and applying for internships and apprenticeships in their region. The project involved utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to build a comprehensive web solution. Throughout the process, we acquired the fundamental skills of web development, including creating mockups, defining user stories, and implementing the development using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  
                <p>Here's an overview of the project's main stages:</p>
  
                <ol>
                  <li>Gathering Requirements: We began by understanding the requirements and needs of CESI engineering school students regarding internships and apprenticeships. This involved conducting interviews, surveys, and discussions with the target audience. By understanding their pain points and preferences, we established a solid foundation for designing an effective solution.</li>
                  <li>Creating Mockups: To visualize the website's layout, structure, and user interface, we created mockups using Figma. Mockups allowed us to iteratively refine the design, ensuring it aligned with the users' expectations and provided a seamless user experience.</li>
                  <li>Defining User Stories: We utilized agile methodologies to define user stories, which represented the various tasks, actions, and interactions users would perform on the website. Each user story captured a specific user goal and described the expected functionality and behavior. These user stories served as a roadmap for our development process.</li>
                  <li>Front-end Development: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we developed the front-end of the website. We focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that aligned with the mockups and catered to the target audience's preferences. The front-end development involved implementing responsive design, navigation menus, forms, search functionality, and other interactive elements.</li>
                  <li>Back-end Development: We utilized PHP, a server-side scripting language, for the back-end development. This involved creating the necessary server-side logic to handle user requests, process form submissions, interact with databases, and manage user authentication and authorization. We designed the back-end to ensure secure data handling, efficient data retrieval, and seamless integration with the front-end.</li>
                  <li>Database Integration: We implemented a database system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to store and manage the internship and apprenticeship data. We designed the database schema to effectively organize and query the information. Integration between the back-end and the database allowed us to retrieve and display relevant internship and apprenticeship listings to the website users.</li>
                  <li>Testing and Quality Assurance: Throughout the development process, we conducted thorough testing to ensure the website's functionality, usability, and compatibility across different browsers and devices. We performed unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests to identify and fix any issues or bugs. Additionally, we incorporated feedback from CESI engineering school students to refine the website further.</li>
                  <li>Deployment and Maintenance: Once the website development was complete, we deployed it to a web server to make it accessible to CESI engineering school students. We ensured the website's stability, security, and performance through regular maintenance and updates. Ongoing support and monitoring were provided to address any user inquiries or technical issues that arose.</li>
                </ol>
  
                <p>Throughout the project, effective collaboration, communication, and project management played a crucial role in achieving our goals. We documented the development process, technical specifications, and user documentation to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.</p>
  
                <p>By successfully completing this web development project, our team gained valuable experience in creating websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. We provided CESI engineering school students with a user-friendly platform to find and apply for internships and apprenticeships, helping them take the next steps in their careers.</p>
